;;; Project 1, 6.001, Spring 2005

;;; idea is to simulate a baseball robot

;; imagine hitting a ball with an initial velocity of v 
;; at an angle alpha from the horizontal, at a height h
;; we would like to know how far the ball travels.

;; as a first step, we can just model this with simple physics
;; so the equations of motion for the ball have a vertical and a 
;; horizontal component

;; the vertical component is governed by
;; y(t) = v sin alpha t + h - 1/2 g t^2 
;; where g is the gravitational constant of 9.8 m/s^2

;; the horizontal component is governed by
;; x(t) = v cos alpha t
;; assuming it starts at the origin

;; First, we want to know when the ball hits the ground
;; this is governed by the quadratic equation, so we just need to know when 
;; y(t)=0 (i.e. for what t_impact is y(t_impact)= 0).
;; note that there are two solutions, only one makes sense physically

(define square
  (lambda (x) (* x x)))

;; these are constants that will be useful to us
(define gravity 9.8)  ;; in m/s
(define pi 3.14159)

;; Problem 1

(define position
  (lambda (a v u t)
    ;; p(t) = (1/2)*a*t^2 + v*t + u
    (+ (* 0.5 a (square t)) (* v t) u)))

;; you need to complete this procedure, then show some test cases

;; Note that if we want to know when the ball drops to a particular height r 
;; (for receiver), we have

;; Problem 4

;; once we can solve for t_impact, we can use it to figure out how far the ball went

;; about things in English units, so we will need some conversions.

;; what is time to impact for a ball hit at a height of 1 meter
;; with a velocity of 45 m/s (which is about 100 miles/hour)
;; at an angle of 0 (straight horizontal)
;; at an angle of (/ pi 2) radians or 90 degrees (straight vertical)
;; at an angle of (/ pi 4) radians or 45 degrees

;; what is the distance traveled in each case?
